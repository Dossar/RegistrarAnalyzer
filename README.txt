Running scrapeterms.py requires both BeautifulSoup4 and dryscrape to be configured. I suggest installing them on a UNIX
environment as installing on Windows I found to be impossible due to not being able to get the
last component (the webkit-server).

Installation for dryscrape can be found at http://dryscrape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Also I am planning on making Numpy style docstrings as described in
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/documentation/ for the Python functions. There is a lot of work to be
done here, but the parser right now is fairly robust.
